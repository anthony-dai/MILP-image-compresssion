# MILP-image-compresssion

Implementation of the MATLAB code for the branch-and-bound algorithm for image compression.

The MATLAB code is specifically only for the branch and bound algorithm and is in moduloCS.m, in which it calls projection_onto_A.m and generate_fat_random_matrix.m

The rest are jupyter notebooks in python for the traditional compressed sensing algorithms: MP, OMP, IHT, CoSAMP

the train and test dataset of MNIST needs to be downloaded separately since we are not able to upload it on github.
